# Splunk AWS Serverless Apps
Splunk AWS Serverless applications and [Lambda blueprints](https://www.splunk.com/blog/2016/11/29/announcing-new-aws-lambda-blueprints-for-splunk.html), including associated CloudFormation templates (using [SAM](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model)) for automated packaging & deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI
- Node.js v4.3 or later.
- Splunk Enterprise 6.3.0 or later, or Splunk Cloud.
- Splunk HTTP Event Collector token from your Splunk Enterprise server.
- S3 bucket to host artifacts uploaded by CloudFormation e.g. Lambda ZIP deployment packages

You can use the following command to create the Amazon S3 bucket, say in `us-east-1` region
```
aws s3 mb s3://<my-bucket-name> --region us-east-1
```

### Installing
First cd into any of the serverless applications:
```
cd splunk-cloudwatch-logs-processor
```
Copy over the sample `.npmrc`:
```
cp .npmrc.sample .npmrc
```
Then modify `.npmrc` file to set required configuration settings to match your environment, such as `parm_hec_url` which specifies the URL of your Splunk HTTP Event Collector endpoint.

Then install node package dependencies:
```
npm install
```

### Packaging
To build the Serverles Application Module deployment package:
```
npm run build:zip
```
This will package the necessary Lambda function(s) and dependencies into one local deployment zip as specified in `package.json` build script. i.e. for Splunk CloudWatch Serverless Application it creates `splunk-cloudwatch-logs-processor.zip`

Then upload all local artifacts needed by the SAM template to your previously created S3 bucket. You can do this either using **npm** task or directly using **AWS CLI**:

**Upload using npm:**

Before you run this command please ensure that you have set correct values in your application .npmrc
```
npm run build:template
```

**Upload using AWS CLI**
```
aws cloudformation package 
    --template template.yaml 
    --s3-bucket <my-bucket-name> 
    --output-template-file template.output.yaml
```

The command returns a copy of the SAM template, in this case `template.output.yaml`, replacing all references to local artifacts with the S3 location where the command uploaded the artifacts. In particular, `CodeUri` property of the Lambda resource points to the deployment zip `splunk-cloudwatch-logs-processor.zip` in the Amazon S3 bucket that you specified.

### Deploying
**Deploy using npm:**

Before you run this command please ensure that you have set correct values in your application .npmrc
```
npm run build:deployment
```

**Deploy using AWS CLI**

Example below is specific to Splunk Splunk CloudWatch Serverless Application. `parameter-overrides` will differ by Splunk Serverless Application and you will need to adjust accordingly. Alternatively, you can use npm task above which retrieves the configurations defined in .npmrc
```
aws cloudformation deploy 
    --template $(pwd)/template.output.yaml 
    --parameter-overrides 
        SplunkHttpEventCollectorURL='https://<my-splunk-ip-or-fqdn>:8088/services/collector' 
        SplunkHttpEventCollectorToken=<my-splunk-hec-token> 
        CloudWatchLogsGroupName=<my-cwl-group-name> 
    --capabilities "CAPABILITY_IAM" --stack-name my-cloudwatch-logs-forwarder-stack
```

## Development & Test

### Available npm tasks
For each serverless application, you can use the following npm tasks:

| command | description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run set:env`| creates .npmrc file in your local project. set project variables here |
| `npm run lint` | run eslint rules against .js files |
| `npm run build:zip` | create zip SAM deployment package with required .js files |
| `npm run build:template` | uploads SAM deployment package with required template files to AWS S3 Bucket|
| `npm run build:deployment` | creates CloudFormation Stack and deploys SAM package from AWS S3 Bucket|
| `npm run clean` | remove zip deployment package |
| `npm run test` (or `npm test`) | run simple integration test with live Splunk Enterprise instance. More details in section below. |
| `npm run build` | runs entire build flow: `build:zip` then `build:template` and then `build:deployment` |

### Setup test environment

>>>> This section requires updates <<<<
i.e. instead of setEnv can use
"test": "SPLUNK_HEC_URL=$npm_config_kinesis_hec_url SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN=$npm_config_kinesis_hec_token node integration-test.js",
    
For test-driven development, you can easily run a simple integration test as you develop the Lambda function.
First, copy over the provided setEnv bash script in root folder:
```
cp setEnv.sh.template setEnv.sh
```
Modify `setEnv.sh` contents to set the values of `SPLUNK_HEC_URL` and `SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN` to point to a local (or remote) Splunk Enterprise test instance and its valid HEC token. Then, source these environment variables:
```
source setEnv.sh
```
### Run integration test
Now, you can run a simple integration test to validate functionality of the Lambda function and ensure events are being indexed correctly in Splunk Enterprise:
```
npm test
```
This command first runs lint checks against Lambda function code. Only after successfully lint checks, this command will run the Lambda function passing it the event in `sampleEvent.json` along with `SPLUNK_HEC_URL` and `SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN` environment variables. The function output and final status is directed to standard out. Here's an example of a successful execution:
```bash
$ npm test
> splunk-cloudwatch-logs-processor@0.8.1 pretest
> npm run lint
...
> splunk-cloudwatch-logs-processor@0.8.1 test
> node integration-test.js

Received event: {
  "awslogs": {
...
...
}
Done
Decoded payload: {
...
...
}
Sending event(s)
Response received
Response from Splunk:
{"text":"Success","code":0}
Successfully processed 2 log event(s).
[ null, 2 ]
```
